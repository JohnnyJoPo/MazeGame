Maze Game

IDEA -> Maze generator written in JavaScript that renders a maze using a grid display and lets the user play by using the arrow keys to move a red dot across the grid cells

- Default page will mostly be empty
-- Buttons to set maze dimensions
--- Two inputs to hold maze width and height
--- A button to randomly generate the maze using the input dimensions
-- White space to hold the maze when it is created
-- When the maze grid is generated, auto orient it to best fit the user's screen dimensions
--- Grid cells must be squares and the same size
--- Use CSS border or outline properties to draw the maze walls
-- On-screen buttons to control the red dot throughout the maze
--- Bind buttons to arrow keys
--- Enable/Disable buttons based on valid movements from current cell
-- Fifth button to auto solve the maze one move at a time
--- Every time the dot is moved, calculate the route to the end of the maze based on the current position

- Project research
-- Brainstorm different algorithms to generate mazes
-- Do research on existing algorithms and maze types
--- Find or write an algorithm that makes a complex maze without loops, long corridors without junctions, etc

- After initial release / Possible features to implement in the future
-- Styling ideas (make the game more appealing to look at)
--- Do research and practice on 3D effects
--- Color scheme ideas
---- IDEA 1: Color changes over time
---- IDEA 2: Color changes based on proximity to the goal
----- Colors could be colder the further from the goal
----- Gradually transition to yellows and reds when the player gets closer
---- IDEA 3: Color changes based on remaining moves
----- Player could have limited number of moves to reach the goal (new idea for gameplay)
---- IDEA 4: Colors based on maze theme
-- Gameplay / Scripting ideas
--- Add a scoring system to award more points for fewer moves to reach the goal
--- Add a timer to count how long it takes to reach the goal
--- Add a move limit: Reach the end before your run out of moves
---- Move limit = Double the minimum number steps needed to reach the goal
--- Add more objectives
---- Keys to unlock doors in the maze
---- Enemies that move towards the player each move or have other behaviors
---- Treasures to collect that boost score or have other effects
-- Maze theme Ideas
--- Pyramid / Desert Temple
---- Pharaoh's tomb aesthetic
---- Enemies: Mummies, beetles, cobras, traps
---- Collect gold and treasure from the maze and escape
--- Outer Space
---- Futuristic theme (stars, planets, nebulas, black holes, etc)
---- Enemies: Aliens, rogue astroids, robots
---- Collect ship parts from the maze to build a ship and escape
--- Jailbreak
---- Prison aesthetic (barbed wire, iron bars, cages, indoor setting)
---- Enemies: Guards, guard dogs, other prisoners
---- Navigate and escape from the maze-like prison
--- Fantasy Kingdom
---- Old medieval theme (knights, swords, wizards, dragons, anything Lord of the Rings)
---- Enemies: Orcs, goblins, dragons, witches, mythic creatues
---- Make your way though the dungeon
--- Ocean Depths
---- Underwater adventure theme (coral reefs, sharks, sunken treasure, fishies)
---- Enemies: Sharks, giant squid, sea urchins, pirates
---- Plunder a sunken ship for treasure and escape from the deep
